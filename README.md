Magmo Apps
</h1>
Welcome to the Magmo mono-repo, home of several proof-of-concept applications built on our state channel protocols.

## For more information

On our [website](https://magmo.com) you will find links to our whitepapers and contact information. Whether you simply want to try
out our apps, or get involved more deeply we would love to hear your thoughts. Deployed versions of our games may be accessed with these links:

- [Rock Paper Scissors](https://rps.magmo.com) (RPS)
- [Tic Tac Toe](https://ttt.magmo.com) (TTT)

## Getting Started

#### Setting up development environment and running a game application

You will need `yarn` installed (see [here](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) for instructions). After cloning the code,

1. In the top directory, run `yarn install`.
2. Run `npx lerna bootstrap`.

3. Start [ganache](https://truffleframework.com/ganache) by running `yarn ganache:start` in one of the package directories.
4. (In a new shell) Run the wallet via `yarn start` in the `wallet` package directory
5. (In a new shell) Run a game (either RPS or TTT) via `yarn start` in the relevant package directory.
6. Add [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) to your browser, and point it to `localhost:3001` to view the application. You will need to import one of our (testnet-only) seed accounts into metamask to have funds to transact.
   1. Open the metamask browser extension
   2. Click on the account icon (circle in the top right)
   3. Select "Import"
   4. Paste in one of [these secret keys](https://github.com/magmo/devtools/blob/master/utils/startGanache.js).

You may visit the app in two different browsers in order to play against yourself. We use [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools) to develop and test our apps.

#### Configuration

All default configuration values are located in the `.env` and `.env.production` files.
These can be overridden by adding a `.env.local` or `.env.production.local` and specifying values there.

#### To run storybook

We use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to view our react components during development. You can start Storybook by running:

```
yarn storybook
```

in the relevant package directory. This will fire up the Storybook panel inside a browser.

#### To create an optimized production build:

1. Optionally override the `TARGET_NETWORK` by setting the value in your `.env.production.local` file. Otherwise the application will be built against the ropsten test network.
2. Build the application:

   ```
   yarn run build
   ```

#### To deploy smart contracts

1. Add test eth to your account for the deployment using an eth faucet: https://faucet.ropsten.be/ or https://faucet.metamask.io.
2. Set `TARGET_NETWORK` in your `.env.local` file to the network you want to deploy to: either `'development'`, `'ropsten'`, `'kovan'` or `'rinkeby'`.
3. Deploy the contracts to the network:
   `yarn deployContracts`
   Alternatively, simply run, e.g. `TARGET_NETWORK=ropsten yarn deployContracts`.

#### Running Tests specific to a certain app

From the relevant subdirectory...

- To run application tests in watch mode:

```
yarn test:app
```

- To run smart contract tests:

```
yarn test:contracts
```

- To run all tests relating (before submitting a PR):

```
yarn test
```

- To update dependencies:

```
npx lerna bootstrap
```

- To add a dependency:

```
npx lerna add [dependency name] --scope=[target package]
```

This installs the latest version of the dependency to the target package (ttt, rps or wallet). Use `--dev` flag to add the new package to `devDependencies` instead of `dependencies`.

- To update the version of a dependency:

```
yarn upgrade [package-name@version-number]
```

## Documentation

We are working hard to produce documenation for our applications. In the interim, please see our [Developer Handbook](https://magmo.gitbook.io/developer-handbook/), which as some of the hints and tips
for developing on ethereum that we have used to develop our apps. You will also find some information in the `/notes/` subdirectory of each app.

## Problems?

Frequently, problems can be sorted by one or more of the following steps:

- Resetting your MetaMask account (i.e. deleting transaction history), or simply switching to a different network and back again.
- Restarting ganache
- Running `npx lerna bootstrap` if you changed any dependencies

Otherwise, please check [issues](https://github.com/magmo/rps/issues), someone else may have had the same experience. You may find a solution -- if not, please add to or create an issue.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you want to contribute, you should be aware of the following conventions:

#### Prettier

Prettier is configured via `.prettierrc`.
Tests will fail if code does not satisfy the rules specificied in `.prettierrc`.
We suggest that you configure your editor to auto-format using prettier,
or that you run it in a pre-commit git hook.
You can also run `yarn prettier:write`.

#### Naming

- Directories and files should be kebab-cased.

```
// ok
foo/bar/foo-bar/foo-bar.ts

// ok
foo/bar/foo-bar/foo-bar.tsx

// tslint error
foo/bar/foo-bar/fooBar.ts

// tslint error
foo/bar/foo-bar/FooBar.tsx

// no tslint error, but please avoid this

// no tslint error, but please avoid this
