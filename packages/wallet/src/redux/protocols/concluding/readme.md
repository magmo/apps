# Concluding

The concluding protocols coordinate the process of concluding a channel.

## The Protocol

The concluding protocol involves two parties: instigator and responder.
The instigator is identified by being a participant who has chosen to conclude the channel. The responder is a participant who has received a conclude commitment and responds in kind.

We therefore split the overall indirect-funding protocol into two sub state machines:
[instigator](./instigator) and [responder](./responder).

The two state machines interact through the following messages:

```mermaid

  participant I as I's wallet
  participant R as R's wallet
  Note  over I, R: Exchange Concludes
  I->>R: Conclude
  R->>I: Conclude
  Note  over I, R: Defund L (sub-protocol)

```
