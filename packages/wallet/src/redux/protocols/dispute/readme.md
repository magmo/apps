# Dispute

The dispute protocol coordinate the processes of challenging and responding to inactivity in a channel.

## The Protocol

The dispute protocol involves two parties: challenger and responder.
The challenger submits a forceMove transaction. The responder spots the blockchain event and either responds in time (and the channel continues) or fails to. In the latter case, the channel is closed and may be defunded.

We therefore split the overall dispute protocol into two sub state machines: [challenger](./challenger/readme.md) and [responder](./responder/readme.md).

The two state machines interact through the following messages:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant C as C's wallet
  participant R as R's wallet
  participant A as Adjudicator
  Note over C: Launch challenge
  C->>A: forceMove tx
  A->>R: challenge event
  Note over R: Respond?
  R-->>A: response tx
  A-->>C: response event
  A-->>R: response event
  Note  over C, R: Defund? (sub-protocol)

```

Note: If Respond? then !Defund.
