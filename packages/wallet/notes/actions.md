# Action unions

Hopefully `ProtocolAction` is self explanatory: it is the union of top level protocol actions, each consumed by their respective protocol reducer.

`CommonAction` is the union of `MessageReceived` and `CommitmentReceived` action. These actions are used in several protocols, although mostly the CommitmentReceived action, which is often included in the `MyProtocolAction` union on its own, while the `isMyProtocolAction` guard (somewhat inconsistently) uses `isCommonAction`.

`RelayableAction` is the union of those actions that are whitelisted for communication to the opponent, who will dispatch that action.

`ChannelAction` is the union actions consumed by the channel-store reducer.

Actions not in a union handle things such as showing / hiding the wallet.
